Matrix multiplication is essential in linear algebra, with applications in fields like computer graphics, quantum mechanics, and machine learning. 


Within this project I explore two key algorithms: the naive method and Strassen's algorithm, focusing on their time complexities, memory requirements, and practical considerations.


Within this project I:

Implemented and analyze the naive method
Explored Strassen's algorithm
Compared memory requirements
Discussed practical considerations
Considered a MapReduce approach for large-scale matrix multiplication
