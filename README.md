# Matrix Multiplication: Algorithms Explored  

In this project, I dive into the fundamental operation of matrix multiplication, which has applications in fields such as computer graphics, quantum mechanics, and machine learning.  

This project focuses on understanding and comparing different approaches to matrix multiplication. Here's what I cover:  

- **Implementation and analysis of the naive method** ✅  
- **Exploration of Strassen's algorithm** ✅  
- **Comparison of memory requirements** ✅  
- **Discussion of practical considerations** ✅  
- **Evaluation of a MapReduce approach for large-scale matrix multiplication** ✅  

This is an ongoing exploration aimed at understanding the strengths, trade-offs, and practical applications of these techniques.
